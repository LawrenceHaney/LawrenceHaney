      In Fall of 2020 I enrolled in Boise Codeworks’ Immersive Full Stack Program to pursue the skills to deepen my understanding of development cycles. From engaging in SCRUM governed projects with peers to building out full stack applications Codeworks provided a solid foundation to build upon. I’m currently seeking employment in the Boise Idaho market and hope to continue to grow as I learn.

    I have a background in logistics, data entry, customer service, and sales. While at ABU Games I was fascinated by the systems used to track and manage workflow for their online distribution and found myself engaged in projects to help streamline this system. From reworking warehouse layouts to optimizing receiving workflows, I cut my teeth on writing simple excel tools that reduced redundant tasks and led to faster and more accurate order processing.
