    <h4 class=""> About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a full stack software developer with experience based in JavaScript, and C#. I have experience working with various frameworks including Vue 2 and am currently excited about the upcoming changes that Vue 3 introduces. I enjoy the persistent puzzle that programming offers and thrive when solving new problems.</p>
    <p>
      I have a firm understanding of Object Oriented Programing and the SOLID principles that govern modern programing practices. Iâ€™ve built full stack applications with Node.js backends as well as C#. I hope to employ my development skills to build out elegant and response applications that exceed user expectations.
