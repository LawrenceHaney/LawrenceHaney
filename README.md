I'm a full stack software developer with experience based in **JavaScript**, and **C#**. I have experience working with various frameworks including **Vue** 2 and am currently excited about the upcoming changes that vue 3 introduces. I enjoy the persistent puzzle that programming offers and thrive when solving new problems.

 
I have a background in logistics, data entry, customer service, and sales. While at ABU Games I was fascinated by the systems used to track and manage workflow for their online distribution and found myself engaged in projects to help streamline this system. From reworking warehouse layouts to optimizing receiving workflows, I cut my teeth on writing simple excel tools that reduced redundant tasks and led to faster and more accurate order processing.

  
In Fall of 2020 I enrolled in Boise Codeworks’ Immersive Full Stack Program to pursue the skills to deepen my understanding of development cycles. From engaging in **SCRUM** governed projects with peers to building out full stack applications Codeworks provided a solid foundation to build upon. I’m currently seeking employment in the Boise Idaho market and hope to continue to grow as I learn.

  
I have a firm understanding of **Object Oriented Programing** and the **SOLID** principles that govern modern programing practices. I’ve built full stack applications with **Node.js** backends as well as **C#**. I hope to employ my development skills to build out elegant and response applications that exceed user expectations.

When not behind the keyboard you can find my teaching and designing hobbyist board games, playing in amature disc golf leagues and occasinally judging and overseeing competitive card tournaments.
